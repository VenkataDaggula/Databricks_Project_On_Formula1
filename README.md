Azure Databricks & Spark Core for Data Engineering
This repository contains resources for a comprehensive course on building data engineering solutions using Azure Databricks and Spark Core. The course is designed to help you build a real-world data project based on Formula1 motor racing data using modern cloud technologies like Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure Data Factory, Power BI, and Delta Lake.

Key Technologies Covered:
Azure Databricks:

Creating and managing Databricks service, clusters, and notebooks
Working with Databricks File System (DBFS), Delta Lake, and Lakehouse architecture
Using PySpark and Spark SQL for data transformation and analysis
Monitoring and managing Databricks clusters, jobs, and workflows
Mounting Azure Storage in Databricks using Azure Key Vault
Spark Core:

Ingestion and transformation of data using PySpark and Spark SQL
Dataframe API, SQL transformations (e.g., Filter, Join, Aggregation, Window functions)
Implementing incremental and full refresh patterns with partitions
Delta Lake:

Working with Delta Lake: Read, Write, Update, Delete, and Merge operations
Implementing Time Travel and History for data consistency
Converting Parquet to Delta format and working with incremental data loads
Azure Data Factory:

Creating and scheduling pipelines for orchestrating Databricks jobs
Designing robust pipelines to handle errors and unexpected scenarios (e.g., missing files)
Monitoring and managing pipeline triggers and outputs
Power BI:

Connecting Azure Databricks tables to Power BI for report generation and dashboard visualization
Unity Catalog (Data Governance):

Overview and configuration of Unity Catalog for data governance
Setting up a Metastore and managing access control, data lineage, and auditing
Learning Outcomes:
By the end of the course, you will be proficient in the following:

Building end-to-end data engineering solutions using Azure Databricks and Spark Core
Understanding and implementing Lakehouse Architecture with Delta Lake
Creating and managing Databricks notebooks, clusters, and jobs
Ingesting, transforming, and analyzing data using PySpark and Spark SQL
Developing Azure Data Factory pipelines for scheduling and monitoring Databricks jobs
Connecting Power BI to Azure Databricks for visualizing data and creating reports
Understanding Unity Catalog for managing data governance and security
Course Focus:
Azure Databricks: The course focuses on using PySpark and Spark SQL within Azure Databricks, with no coverage of Scala or Java.
Delta Lake and Lakehouse Architecture: Implementing a modern data architecture for reliable, scalable data lakes.
Azure Data Factory: Automating and orchestrating workflows for data pipelines.
Power BI: Connecting to Databricks data for reporting and visualization.
